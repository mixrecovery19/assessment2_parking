# Assessment 2 - Parking Management

A very basic program to handle data written in Python for Assessment 2 & 3
of my assessments during TAFE ICTPRG549 Dimploma in ICT module.
In this assessment/module we covered what is considered intermediate introductory to GUI as well as the storing and returning of data, which is why I kept both json & the database examples in the final assessment.
I did not spend much emphasis on the GUI in the sense of color coding sections, or sizes of the windows as this is very easy to edit based on requirments.
